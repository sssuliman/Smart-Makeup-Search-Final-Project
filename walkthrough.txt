SMART MAKEUP SEARCH PROJECT - WALKTHROUGH

Overview:
----------
This project implements a command-line tool that allows users to search through a curated dataset of makeup products using prefix-based search. 
The search is powered by a Trie data structure, allowing autocomplete-like matching. Users can type one or more prefix terms, 
and the tool returns full product lines that contain words starting with all given prefixes.

How it Works:
-------------
1. The program loads a dataset from:
   data/products_organized_full.txt

2. Each full product line (e.g., brand, category, product) is read and broken into words.
   Each word is inserted into a Trie. At each word’s end, the full product line is stored.

3. The user enters one or more prefixes (e.g., "foun oily").
   For each prefix, the program finds all matching words and collects their associated product lines.

4. The final result shows only the product lines that match all given prefixes.

How to Use:
-----------
1. Open terminal in your project directory.
2. Compile the code:
   make

3. Run the program:
   ./SmartMakeupSearch

4. You’ll see a prompt:
   Enter prefix term(s): foun oily
   (Press Enter to get results)

5. Type 'exit' to quit.

File Summary:

- main.cpp        → Handles reading, searching, and user interaction
- Trie.h / Trie.cpp → Implements the prefix-based Trie with full line storage
- Makefile        → Compiles main and Trie source files
- data/products_organized_full.txt → Makeup product dataset

Example Searches:
