# Walkthrough – Smart Makeup Search Using Trie Data Structure

## 1. Project Summary
This C++ application helps users search for makeup products using a smart autocomplete system powered by a Trie (prefix tree). Users type a partial product name and receive fast suggestions that match the prefix.

## 2. How It Works
- The program loads a list of makeup products from a file (`products.txt`)
- Each product name is inserted into the Trie
- When a user types in a prefix, the Trie is searched using DFS to collect and return all valid word suggestions that start with that prefix

## 3. Example Use Case
If the user types: fen
The oytput will be: 
	•	Fenty Foundation
	•	Fenty Lip Gloss
