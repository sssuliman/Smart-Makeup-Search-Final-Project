# Smart Makeup Search Using Trie Data Structure

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This C++ project implements a **smart search tool for makeup products** using a **Trie (prefix tree)**. The Trie data structure allows users to type in a partial keyword and receive **real-time autocomplete suggestions**, just like a product search bar on modern beauty platforms.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

As a makeup enthusiast and a computer science student, I wanted to merge beauty and tech by creating a fast and intelligent way to search for products. Tries are particularly well-suited for applications like predictive text and search engines, making them perfect for this task.

## ðŸ§° Data Structure Used

- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A tree-based structure where each node represents a character. It allows for:
  - Efficient insertion and search
  - Autocompletion of product names
  - Real-time prefix queries

## ðŸ–¥ Features

- Load makeup product names from a file
- Search for product names by prefix
- Return fast, sorted autocomplete suggestions
